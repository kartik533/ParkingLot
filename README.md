# ParkingLot
--A parking lot system built using Java which offers Small, Medium &amp; Large parking slots. 

--Users have the option to upgrade to large parking slots if the smaller slots are full. 

--For e.g if the small slots are full the user can upgrade to a medium slot if the medium slots are also full, the user can upgrade to a     large slot. 

--On entry, the user is issued a ticket number. On exit the user provides this ticket number and shown his parking charges based on the --   parking time and the slot he used.

--Unzip the ParkingLot zip and import as eclispe project. Cheers.
